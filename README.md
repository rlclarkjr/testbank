# Bad Bank - MIT

## App Information

### TMNT BANK

### Description:

It is the Bad Bank Capstone Project for MITxPRO Fullstack Development with MERN. The name is given in the course because it has unsecured user information. I added TMNT Bank to mine because I thought it would be a little different.
